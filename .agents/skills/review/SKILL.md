name: review
description: Run a multi-perspective technical audit and review (Skeptic, Architect, Pragmatist, Security, Maintainer, User) on code, architecture, plans, or PRs. Trigger with "/review".
argument-hint: "[code, design, plan, PR, or architecture target]"
---

# Purpose

The `/review` skill provides an independent, multi-perspective technical evaluation of code, plans, pull requests, or architecture designs for **{{PROJECT_NAME}}** before committing to implementation.

The goal is to surface hidden risks, weak assumptions, security vulnerabilities, maintainability bottlenecks, and architectural debt early.

---

## Step 1 — Context & Target Gathering

1. **Inspect Repository Context**:
   - Read `.agents/memory/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for architecture, tech stack, and project goals.
   - Review relevant project standards in `.agents/standards/` (e.g., `coding-standards.md`, `workflow-standards.md`).

2. **Identify Review Target**:
   - If an argument is provided (e.g. `/review src/auth.ts` or `/review docs/plan.md`), inspect the target file or directory directly.
   - If un-argumented, inspect current git status / diff or ask the user to specify what to review.

3. **Build the Brief**:
   - Summarize the target, intent, and primary constraints into a single concise Review Brief.

---

## Step 2 — Convene the Review Panel

Evaluate the Review Brief from six completely independent viewpoints against project standards:

### Panel Viewpoints

#### 1. The Skeptic
*Assumption: This project or design will fail in production.*
- Challenge core assumptions, unhandled edge cases, and hidden complexity.
- Identify potential failure modes, implicit technical debt, and weak assumptions.

#### 2. The Architect
*Focus: Long-term structure, elegance, and standards compliance.*
- Evaluate modularity, separation of concerns, scalability, and adherence to project standards in `.agents/standards/`.
- Recommend structural improvements, decoupling strategies, or pattern alignments.

#### 3. The Pragmatist
*Focus: Execution velocity and return on investment.*
- Evaluate implementation effort, complexity vs. reward, and potential over-engineering.
- Identify opportunities to simplify, scope-cut, or reach MVP faster.

#### 4. The Security & Reliability Specialist
*Focus: Operational safety and resilience.*
- Evaluate input validation, state bounds, error handling, failure isolation, and security risks.
- Identify highest-impact operational and security vulnerabilities.

#### 5. The Maintainer
*Focus: Long-term maintainability and developer experience.*
- Evaluate readability, naming, documentation sync, testability, and onboarding friction.
- Recommend changes to reduce cognitive load and future maintenance cost.

#### 6. The User / API Consumer
*Focus: Interface ergonomics and end-user outcomes.*
- Evaluate API design clarity, developer experience (DX), intuitive workflows, and usability.
- Identify frustrating, redundant, or awkward interface choices.

## Step 3 — Deliver Synthesized Verdict

Synthesize all six panel perspectives into a unified recommendation. Do not simply average opinions—resolve contradictions by prioritizing long-term project quality and stability.

Format output as follows:

```markdown
# Technical Review Verdict — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## Recommendation: [ APPROVE | REVISE | REDESIGN ]
**Overall Confidence:** [ Low | Medium | High ]  
**Overall Risk Score:** [ 1-10 ]

### Executive Summary
Concise synthesis of the review outcome and core rationale.

### Panel Scores & Findings Matrix
| Role | Risk (1-10) | Key Focus |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Skeptic | X/10 | Core concern or observation |
| Architect | X/10 | Core concern or observation |
| Pragmatist | X/10 | Core concern or observation |
| Security | X/10 | Core concern or observation |
| Maintainer | X/10 | Core concern or observation |
| User / DX | X/10 | Core concern or observation |
